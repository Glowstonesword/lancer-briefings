To many, taking a job against the union was equivalent to suicide. The paychecks were always exorbitant, contacts were always desperate. Of course, they had very good reason to be. The Unionâ€™s campaign to rebuild their empire left ash, blood, and twisted iron in its wake. The galaxy watched as planets and systems fell, one by one, with a brutal and terrifying efficiency.

Maybe it was their own desperation for cash that drove them to take the job. Maybe it was a foolhardy attempt to spread their brand, as the ones who drove off the Union. Either way, his company took the job, and he found himself laying back in a totaled carcass of a mech, barely conscious as the world burned around him.

Odin Galant should be dead. Most records already state him as such.

Some Lancers are very stubborn.
