Kirche, often lovingly called Kirk, worked his time at Horus as an NHP Specialist. During that time Kirk experimented with various AIs and other NHPs. One such Experiment ended terribly. The experiment he was working on ended up fracturing making the AI unstable and mostly a memory. The AI Fragments had gotten away. HORUS hired him to find and gather the fragmented AIs and destroy them if need be. 

After his travels he came to regret his nasty work with those NHPs. Kirk now works on cultivating the NHPs he has with him; a Servant-class NHP that he uses to help pilot his mech at times, along with the unstable AI he experimented on that doesn't remember the experiments. Kirk is trying his best to help the NHP adapt to life and learn and pilot with him. Not many know of his experiments. 

Now having left HORUS with one of their mechs on his quest to find the missing fragments Kirk travels the final frontier. To most people, he pilots his mech with his Brother Church.
