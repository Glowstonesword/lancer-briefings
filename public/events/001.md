# MISSION AVAILABLE - OPEN CHANNEL [OPEN CONTRACTS > IPS-N] 
Greetings, Lancers.

This is a mission from Constellation, a subsidiary of IPS-N.

Grid SC-I-63 is currently under contention for control between several corporations, despite the legal rights belonging to Constellation. Specifically, SSC-associated finance group 'FRAGMENT' are attempting to claim the area forcefully in hopes proven occupation will bring the grid under their control legally, hiring a mixture of local mercenaries and a small number from further afield associated with the Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company.

Your objective is to destroy the local MT group, along with disabling or otherwise removing any Lancers in the area, and reclaim control of the base. This area provides valuable natural resources that are key to long-term functioning in the area, particularly important for the settling of new colonies.

We anticipate your positive response.
