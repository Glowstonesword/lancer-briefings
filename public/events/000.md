# MISSION AVAILABLE - OPEN CHANNEL [OPEN CONTRACTS > SSF]
This is an open call for pilots for a peacekeeping mission, with the possibility of further collaboration depending on the outcome of the mission.

We are looking for skilled pilots above Grade 1E9K and with HAL-SEC credentials, as there may be complications with the reclamation of the plant.

Further details will be provided upon arrival to the Gibraltar Complex, located in sector SC-E-94.

We look forward to working with you.
