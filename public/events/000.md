# MISSION AVAILABLE - OPEN CHANNEL [OPEN CONTRACTS > SSF]
This is an open call for pilots for a peacekeeping mission, with the possibility of further collaboration depending on the outcome of the mission. The Scrapheap Security Force is looking for subcontractors to aid in the identification of forces who have claimed a fuel manafacturing plant within the Erren Plain, removal of said hostile occupents, elimination of a priority target, and holding of the plant until **SSF** forces can move in to aid with the re-activation of the plant.

We are looking for skilled pilots above Grade 1E9K and with HAL-SEC credentials, as there may be complications with the reclamation of the plant.

Further details will be provided upon arrival to the Gibraltar Complex, located in sector SC-E-94.

We look forward to working with you.

# LOCATION: GIBRALTAR COMPLEX, EXTERIOR [SC-E-94]
With a call to aid sent by the Scrapheap Security Force to mercenaries around Scrapheap, a variety of different individuals found themselves arriving at the Gibraltar Complex, looking to take on the mission. 

First to arrive was **BG-001** - a mercenary with a very redacted past - otherwise known as **WHISPER**, landing in a shuttle on the retrofitted landing bay of the Gibraltar - a former cruiser, now converted into a base of operations for the **SSF**. Making his way into the main hangar bay after departing his mech, the GMS XV '**ZENITH**', he observed that the vessel's interior now resembled a shopping mall than a war-ready vessel's interior, he immediately got lost.

Soon to follow through the landing bay was **KIRCHE ALBEDO**, callsign **ECHO** - along with his subaltern companion, **CHURCH**. Leaving **CHURCH** to keep a watchful eye over his mech, the mercenary makes his way down into the refurbished capital ship.

One after another, several more members arrived through the 'front gate' - the old landing bay for the Gibraltar. Leading the charge in a quite literal fashion was **KATZEN SCANAGATTA** - callsign **MITTENS** - on all-fours with her mech, **SOMBRA**. Quickly diverted to the 'express' queue on account of the rather obvious Lancer-ness of the individual, the guard gave her an exasperated look-over before letting them past.

A similar look was given to **ODIN GALLANT**, callsign **CORVUS**, as he swaggered up in his mech, **SOLEMN RAVEN**. Less so for the appearance, and more for the rather long sheet of bounties upon scanning him. All the same, orders were orders - and so through he went as well.

Thankfully, the gate guard met somewhat of a kindred spirit with **MICAH BARRETT**, callsign **JAVELIN**. Giving the guard a quick pep talk that made his day slightly less migraine-inducing, **JAVELIN** soon followed the rest inside in his mech, named the same as his callsign, and entered the Gibraltar Complex.

# LOCATION: GIBRALTAR COMPLEX, INTERIOR [SC-E-94]
The inside of the Gibraltar Complex were surprising to several of the mercenaries now entering it. Old crew quarters converted to operation centres and full-on barracks, former maintenance shafts to corridors and shortcuts, and the main hangar bay to the highlight of the complex; something half way between a shopping mall and a neighbourhood. Most of the party found their way to the meeting room without too much issue - **ECHO** having a keen sense of direction, while **CORVUS** and **MITTENS** were very much used to merc work, and quickly found their way up above the main hangar bay to the military sector. **JAVELIN** asked around, and got the direction pointed out by a patrolling **SSF** member. On the way, he picked up **WHISPER**, who was thoroughly lost, and brought him to the meeting room.

The various mercenaries found themselves in a barracks area, waiting as another group of prospective hires went in. **JAVELIN** and **WHISPER** talked amongst themselves briefly, with **ECHO** occasionally chiming in, about the situation and how they ended up here. **MITTENS** and **CORVUS** kept to themselves - that is, until **ECHO** walked up to **MITTENS** and inquired about her height. In turn, **MITTENS** inquired about **WHISPER**'s sensibilities, and flicked him in the forehead with her mechanical tail. **WHISPER** nodded at this and went back to sit down next to 'pops', his new name for **JAVELIN**. **CORVUS** smirked at the interplay.

Soon after, the group were witness to the previous band of prospective hires leaving in a huff - complaining about the situation. **JAVELIN** observed that they looked surprisingly fatigued, as if they'd been in combat, despite nary a scratch on their person; similarly, **ECHO** noticed increased heart rate and adrenaline with no discernable cause. They quickly discussed this, before a uniformed figure came to meet the group; **MD. FAROS RENTHAL**. After a brief impromptu interrogation of the man that resulted in little information, they were taken to the bridge of the former ship.

Entering the bridge, they met **CPT. FERRA AUTUMN**, the commander of the **SSF** in this sector. **CPT AUTUMN** was light on details for the mission, describing an assault mission on a base taken over by bandit forces with a priority target for extermination, but requiring the group to go through a testing procedure first to ensure their suitability for the job - after all, despite the stated requirements, there may be people trying to slip in for the paycheck above their grade. The group was taken down by **MD RENTHAL** to a lower level of the ship, where a holosim chamber had been expanded through hotwiring into a targeting computer for additional bandwith. After a brief geek-out session between **JAVELIN** and **TCH. WINNA ROUGE**, while **CORVUS** ensured the safety of the machinery they were about to be connected to, the group were wired into the virtual reality pods for their test.

The group inspected each other's mechs, along with their own simulated ones. **JAVELIN** joked about potentially 'quietly altering' the simulation to their advantage, to **MITTEN**'s amusement, but to a gentle protest from the good midshipman. **CORVUS** insisted the group get on with it already.

After practising against some training dummies to get accustomed to the simulated environment, the mercenaries were placed into a city environment against an opposing squad of mechs. Through a combination of **SOMBRA**'s agility to dodge significant amounts of incoming fire, **ZENITH**'s impressive accuracy and firepower taking out priority targets, **JAVELIN** providing cover and fire support to the team, **LUCIUS** hacking and altering the opposition with malicious code, and finally **SOLEMN RAVEN** cleaving enemies in twain, the group was successful with nary a scratch.

# LOCATION: GIBRALTAR COMPLEX, INTERIOR [SC-E-94]
Exiting the holosim, **JAVELIN** briefly suggested some improvements to **TCH ROUGE** before the group were taken back to the bridge. Meeting again with **CPT AUTUMN**, the group were informed they were more than suitable for the mission at hand, having exceeded expectations in their performance. They were given some more details of the mission; a **SSF**-protected fuel extraction and refinery plant had been taken over by bandits known as **THE STARVED**, led by **THE HUNGRY MAW**, also known as **ALBERTA MENDENHALL**. A mixture of mech and mechanised infantry resistance was expected, and ideally, damage to the plant itself was to be minimised, with a bonus in accordance. However, for full details, they were required to sign a NDA agreement; they would be permitted to talk about the generalities of the mission, but had to avoid specific discussion of what was encountered during it. An odd requirement that was quickly picked up and picked at by the more experienced mercenaries of the group. **JAVELIN** inquired as to its reasoning, but was stonewalled about the specifics; however, he did notice the contract was surprisingly open and beneficial to the group - suspiciously so. **ECHO** didn't notice any glaring omissions or malicious lies coming from the captain, however. **MITTEMS** similarly began asking about the necessity of the form, but the group was interrupted by **CORVUS**, who - having signed more than one strange form for a mission before - insisted the group get going.

After - grudgingly, in some cases - having signed the form, the group was informed of the reason behind the restricted information available for the mission; **ALBERTA MENDENHALL** was in possession of a **HARVESTER**-class pattern group frame, outlawed by **UNION** for its dangerous construction, high civilian casualties, and historical instability. While not a typical **HARVESTER**-class frame, **THE MAW** was more heavily reinforced, utilising more traditional smelting and forging technologies as opposed to the more nanotechnology-focused standard pattern. The danger thusly lied not as much in the frame itself, but in the potential it offered; a low-cost, high-reproducability **HARVESTER**-class pattern that could be distributed wide-scale without **UNION** or corporative control. This, of course, is not something the **SSF** would particularly like to happen - particularly in the hands of bandits. As such, the group was given their objectives:

- Eliminate or otherwise remove **STARVED** forces occupying the **PLAINWELL FUEL PLANT**.
- Eliminate VIP-0194, '**ALBERTA MENDENHALL**', and her mech, **THE MAW**.
- [OPTIONAL] Minimise damage to the fuel plant.
- [OPTIONAL] Isolate and obtain the pattern for the **HARVESTER**-class pattern variant, to be delivered to the **SSF** for research and containment purposes.
- [OPTIONAL] Prevent full destabilisation of **THE MAW**'s reactor, as its detonation will result in radioactive material being spread across the local area.

The group was also briefed that **THE MAW** was, although heavily armed and armoured, suspected to have a weak heat capacity in exchange for its high performance with lower-grade materials than standard. Something about the name, **THE MAW**, reminded **CORVUS** of something he had encountered in his past life's career - but unable to come up with the information at the moment, he shrugged it off. With civilians evacuated from the plant and the group instructed on their upcoming mission, they were assigned to the care of **LT. RHYS BRIDGES**, who would further brief them and act as handler for the mission. They were given a day to prepare in the quarters of the complex.
