# MISSION AVAILABLE - OPEN CHANNEL [OPEN CONTRACTS > SSF]
This is an open call for pilots for a peacekeeping mission, with the possibility of further collaboration depending on the outcome of the mission. The Scrapheap Security Force is looking for subcontractors to aid in the identification of forces who have claimed a fuel manafacturing plant within the Erren Plain, removal of said hostile occupents, elimination of a priority target, and holding of the plant until SSF forces can move in to aid with the re-activation of the plant.

We are looking for skilled pilots above Grade 1E9K and with HAL-SEC credentials, as there may be complications with the reclamation of the plant.

Further details will be provided upon arrival to the Gibraltar Complex, located in sector SC-E-94.

We look forward to working with you.

# LOCATION: GIBRALTAR COMPLEX, EXTERIOR [SC-E-94]
With a call to aid sent by the Scrapheap Security Force to mercenaries around Scrapheap, a variety of different individuals found themselves arriving at the Gibraltar Complex, looking to take on the mission. 

First to arrive was BG-001 - a mercenary with a very redacted past - otherwise known as WHISPER, landing in a shuttle on the retrofitted landing bay of the Gibraltar - a former cruiser, now converted into a base of operations for the SSF. Making his way into the main hangar bay after departing his mech, the GMS XV 'Zenith', he observed that the vessel's interior now resembled a shopping mall than a war-ready vessel's interior, he immediately got lost.

Soon to follow through the landing bay was Kirche Albedo, callsign ECHO - along with his subaltern companion, Church. Leaving Church to keep a watchful eye over his mech, the mercenary makes his way down into the refurbished capital ship.

One after another, several more members arrived through the 'front gate' - the old landing bay for the Gibraltar. Leading the charge in a quite literal fashion was Katzen Scanagatta - callsign MITTENS - on all-fours with her mech, Sombra. Quickly diverted to the 'express' queue on account of the rather obvious Lancer-ness of the individual, the guard gave her an exasperated look-over before letting them past.

A similar look was given to Odin Gallant, callsign CORVUS, as he swaggered up in his mech, SOLEMN RAVEN. Less so for the appearance, and more for the rather long sheet of bounties upon scanning him. All the same, orders were orders - and so through he went as well.

Thankfully, the gate guard met somewhat of a kindred spirit with Micah Barrett, callsign JAVELIN. Giving the guard a quick pep talk that made his day slightly less migraine-inducing, Micah soon followed the rest inside in his mech, named the same as his callsign, and entered the Gibraltar Complex.


# LOCATION: GIBRALTAR COMPLEX, INTERIOR [SC-E-94]
The inside of the Gibraltar Complex were surprising to several of the mercenaries now entering it. Old crew quarters converted to operation centres and full-on barracks, former maintenance shafts to corridors and shortcuts, and the main hangar bay to the highlight of the complex; something half way between a shopping mall and a neighbourhood.
