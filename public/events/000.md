##### MISSION OFFERING - OPEN CHANNEL [OPEN CONTRACTS > SSF]
This is an open call for pilots for a peacekeeping mission, with the possibility of further collaboration depending on the outcome of the mission. The Scrapheap Security Force is looking for subcontractors to aid in the identification of forces who have claimed a fuel manafacturing plant within the Erren Plain, removal of said hostile occupents, elimination of a priority target, and holding of the plant until SSF forces can move in to aid with the re-activation of the plant.
We are looking for skilled pilots above Grade 1E9K and with HAL-SEC credentials, as there may be further complications with the reclamation of the plant.
Further details will be provided upon arrival to the Gibraltar Complex, located in sector SC-E-94.
We look forward to working with you.
