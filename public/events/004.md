The group received a message from someone they'd met before; **TCH. WINNA ROUGE**, a technician in the Gibraltar Complex, with a request for them.

'INCOMING MESSAGE: [SSF] TCH. WINNA ROGUE
Hey there, Lancers. Whatcha calling yourself now? Steel Flight or something?
Either way, got a quick query for you to handle in exchange for a bit of spending money. Should be quick 'n easy, and Rhys gave it the a-okay to be subsidised. Not as much as your usual jobs, but shouldn't take too long either.
Had a package back to Union intercepted recently. Not the one you sent, but a general one; mixed bits and bobs in it, stuff that's a little over the line for legal in our tastes. Bit of that weird coolant in it too, along with some frames for analysis, such the like.
We traced it back to somewhere 'round the Gibraltar Complex - got stolen before transit, after all. Probably somewhere in the lower levels, if you don't mind asking around, having a look, throw your reps 'n danger around a little bit?
Cheers!
Winna'
